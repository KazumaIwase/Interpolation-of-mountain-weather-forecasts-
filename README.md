## Dummy data
There are csv files(data/dummy_nesw.csv, data/dummy_tenki_to_kurasu.csv) in the data folder, but they are dummy data.
Note that they are not the data used in this research.
Dummy data was created by us to mimic the actual data.
It was generated by making sure that the RMSE of the 8-hour prediction matched, adding errors.
